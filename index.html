        <p>My name is Daniel Eckardt – I have been an Air Macau employee since 2009, acting as a former airline Line Training Captain operating in the A320F fleet and as a General Manager of the Flight Crew Team of an elite successful carrier
          airline. I
          worked steadily for more than 25 years to achieve my position. In the past, I operated as a flight instructor in general and commercial aviation under different flight schools, airlines, administrators in America, Europe, and Asia. I served
          under
          the FAA, JAA/EASA, AACM, which provided me with the knowledge to become an IOSA/IATA/Internal Quality Auditor under Flight Operation and Dispatch specifications. I’m involved in the core of an operation that transports up to 15000
          passengers
          daily by deciding the crew pairing, type of aircraft, required fuel, alternates, Covid Prevention, investigations, conduct, mitigating any threats to guarantee the highest level of safety of a daily operation. I’m involved in the hiring and
          upgrades process of cadets, experienced first officers, and Captains. I participate in the Standard Operating Procedure of the company, internal publications, and programs. The experience allows me to identify people with excellent skills,
          great
          knowledge, and unique elements.</p>
